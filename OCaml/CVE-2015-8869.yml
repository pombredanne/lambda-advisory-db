title: Buffer Overflow and Information Leak
date: 2016-04-29
description: >
  OCaml versions 4.02.3 and earlier have a runtime bug that, on 64-bit platforms, causes sizes arguments to an internal 
  memmove call to be sign-extended from 32 to 64-bits before being passed to the memmove function.
  This leads arguments between 2GiB and 4GiB to be interpreted as larger than they are (specifically, a bit below 2^64), 
  causing a buffer overflow.
  Arguments between 4GiB and 6GiB are interpreted as 4GiB smaller than they should be, causing a possible information leak.
